##About EZSign##
EZSign is a project that dedicated to bring accessibility of legal contract signing process to individuals' daily lives. After comparing existing products in the industry, we found out that *DocuSign Developer API* has most of the features we need to accomplish our project objectives.

Since *DocuSign* is B-to-B model and doesn't apply functionality that can *populate standard templates* for individual accounts, the primary goal of our project is to feature out a way to dynamically generate templates for new user accounts and allow them to receive the same convenience that most employers who use *DocuSign* enjoy.

##Installing##
The project is written in Xcode version 9.4.1. To install and run the project, you need to have an installed `cocoapods` with version 1.3+

```
pod install Podfile
```
